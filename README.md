# Web-Scraping
The provided web scraping code utilizes the `instaloader` library to retrieve and display information from an Instagram profile. The `scrape_instagram_profile` function initializes an `Instaloader` instance and attempts to fetch profile details such as username, full name, biography, follower count, following count, and the number of posts. Additionally, it iterates through the user's recent posts, printing details including the post URL, number of likes, and the post's caption. The script includes error handling to manage any exceptions that may occur during the scraping process. To execute the script, the user is prompted to enter an Instagram username, and the function then outputs the gathered information. This code provides a straightforward method to extract and display Instagram profile data for a specified user, making it useful for various data analysis and research purposes. However, it is important to note that web scraping activities should comply with Instagram's terms of service to avoid potential issues.
